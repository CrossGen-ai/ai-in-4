# AI Developer Workflow (ADW) System

**A meta-agentic development automation system that builds, tests, and improves software through GitHub integration.**

---

## 🚀 Quick Start - Common Workflows

**For humans: Use these commands for everyday tasks.**

### Understanding Workflow Types

ADW has two execution modes:

**Standard Workflows** - Use main repository branch
- Work directly in your main repo directory
- One issue at a time (sequential processing)
- Uses git branches for isolation
- Best for: Single issues, simple changes

**ISO Workflows** - Use isolated git worktrees
- Create separate working directory per issue
- Multiple issues simultaneously (parallel processing)
- Each gets unique ports (no conflicts)
- Best for: Batch processing, parallel execution

### Process an Issue End-to-End

**Standard Mode (uses branch in main repo):**
```bash
# Full workflow: Plan → Build → Test → Review → Document
uv run adws/adw_sdlc.py <issue-number>

# Example: Process issue #123
uv run adws/adw_sdlc.py 123
```

**ISO Mode (uses isolated git worktree):**
```bash
# Same workflow but in isolated environment
uv run adws/adw_sdlc_iso.py <issue-number>

# Example: Process issue #123 in isolation
uv run adws/adw_sdlc_iso.py 123
# Creates: .worktrees/a1b2c3d4/ with unique ports
```

**ZTE Mode (Zero Touch Execution - fully autonomous):**
```bash
# Autonomous workflow with self-healing and auto-deployment
uv run adws/adw_sdlc_zte_iso.py <issue-number>

# Example: Fully autonomous processing of issue #123
uv run adws/adw_sdlc_zte_iso.py 123
# Automatically handles errors, retries, and deploys when ready
```

### Quick Workflows

**Standard (in main repo):**
```bash
# Just plan and build (fastest)
uv run adws/adw_plan_build.py <issue-number>

# Plan, build, and test
uv run adws/adw_plan_build_test.py <issue-number>

# Plan, build, test, and review (no docs)
uv run adws/adw_plan_build_test_review.py <issue-number>
```

**ISO (isolated worktree):**
```bash
# Same workflows but isolated - add _iso suffix
uv run adws/adw_plan_build_iso.py <issue-number>
uv run adws/adw_plan_build_test_iso.py <issue-number>
uv run adws/adw_plan_build_test_review_iso.py <issue-number>
```

### Process Multiple Issues in Parallel (ISO only)

```bash
# Process 5 issues simultaneously - each in isolated worktree
uv run adws/adw_sdlc_iso.py 101 &
uv run adws/adw_sdlc_iso.py 102 &
uv run adws/adw_sdlc_iso.py 103 &
uv run adws/adw_sdlc_iso.py 104 &
uv run adws/adw_sdlc_iso.py 105 &
wait

# Result: 5x faster than sequential processing
# Each gets isolated workspace at .worktrees/<adw-id>/
# Each gets unique ports (no conflicts)
```

### Auto-Process All New Issues

```bash
# Start monitoring (polls GitHub every 20 seconds)
uv run adws/adw_triggers/trigger_cron.py

# Or start webhook server (instant processing)
uv run adws/adw_triggers/trigger_webhook.py
```

### Run Individual Phases

**Standard mode:**
```bash
# Planning only
uv run adws/adw_plan.py <issue-number>

# Implementation only (requires existing plan)
uv run adws/adw_build.py <issue-number> <adw-id>

# Testing only
uv run adws/adw_test.py <issue-number> <adw-id>

# Review only
uv run adws/adw_review.py <issue-number> <adw-id>

# Documentation only
uv run adws/adw_document.py <issue-number> <adw-id>
```

**ISO mode (add _iso suffix):**
```bash
# Each phase in isolated worktree
uv run adws/adw_plan_iso.py <issue-number>
uv run adws/adw_build_iso.py <issue-number> <adw-id>
uv run adws/adw_test_iso.py <issue-number> <adw-id>
uv run adws/adw_review_iso.py <issue-number> <adw-id>
uv run adws/adw_document_iso.py <issue-number> <adw-id>
```

### Prerequisites

## System Overview

### What is ADW?

ADW (AI Developer Workflow) is a **Level 3-4 meta-agentic system** that:
- Automates complete software development lifecycles
- Processes GitHub issues from planning through deployment
- Runs workflows in parallel (up to 15x throughput via worktrees)
- Generates its own capabilities (meta-command generation)
- Tracks and optimizes its own performance (KPI dashboard)
- Self-extends and self-improves

### Capability Levels

**Level 0-1:** Basic automation (script execution)
**Level 2:** Multi-phase workflows (plan → build → test)
**Level 3:** Self-monitoring and optimization (KPI tracking, model selection)
**Level 4:** Self-extension (generates new slash commands)
**Level 5:** Autonomous operation (ZTE - Zero Touch Execution)

**Current ADW Status:** Level 3-4 (moving toward Level 5)

### Architecture Principles

1. **Composability** - Individual phases can run standalone or chained
2. **Isolation** - Worktrees enable parallel execution without conflicts
3. **Type Safety** - End-to-end Pydantic validation
4. **Observability** - All executions tracked with ADW IDs
5. **Self-Improvement** - System generates its own metrics and capabilities

---

## Key Concepts

### ADW ID

Each workflow run gets a unique 8-character identifier (e.g., `a1b2c3d4`).

**Purpose:**
- Tracks all phases of a workflow (plan → build → test → review → document)
- Appears in GitHub comments, commits, PR titles
- Creates isolated workspace at `agents/{adw_id}/`
- Enables resuming workflows and debugging
- Links related workflows in parallel execution

**Format:** `[a-f0-9]{8}` (lowercase hex)

**Example Tracking:**
```
Issue #123 → ADW ID: a1b2c3d4
├── Branch: feat-123-a1b2c3d4-add-user-auth
├── Workspace: agents/a1b2c3d4/
├── Plan: agents/a1b2c3d4/a1b2c3d4_plan_spec.md
├── PR: "feat: Add user authentication (a1b2c3d4)"
└── Commits: All tagged with a1b2c3d4
```

### State Management

ADW uses persistent state files (`agents/{adw_id}/adw_state.json`) to enable workflow composition and chaining.

**State Schema (10 fields):**

```python
{
  "adw_id": str,              # Unique workflow identifier
  "issue_number": str,        # GitHub issue being processed
  "branch_name": str,         # Git branch for changes
  "plan_file": str,           # Path to implementation plan
  "issue_class": str,         # Issue type (/chore, /bug, /feature)

  # Meta-agentic fields (NEW)
  "worktree_path": str,       # Isolated worktree path (for parallel execution)
  "backend_port": int,        # Allocated backend port (9100-9114)
  "frontend_port": int,       # Allocated frontend port (9200-9214)
  "model_set": str,           # "base" (sonnet) or "heavy" (opus)
  "all_adws": List[str]       # All ADW IDs in this workflow chain
}
```

**State Persistence:**
- Written by each workflow phase
- Read by subsequent phases
- Enables resuming after failures
- Tracks workflow history

**State Passing:**
- Via stdin/stdout (piping)
- Via file (`agents/{adw_id}/adw_state.json`)
- Automatically managed by workflow scripts

### Workflow Composition

Workflows can be:

**1. Run Individually**
```bash
uv run adw_plan.py 123              # Planning only
uv run adw_build.py 123 a1b2c3d4    # Implementation only
uv run adw_test.py 123 a1b2c3d4     # Testing only
```

**2. Chained via Pipes**
```bash
uv run adw_plan.py 123 | uv run adw_build.py | uv run adw_test.py
# State flows automatically through stdin/stdout
```

**3. Combined in Orchestrators**
```bash
uv run adw_plan_build.py 123        # Plan + Build
uv run adw_sdlc.py 123              # All phases
```

**4. Run in Parallel (ISO workflows)**
```bash
# Run 5 issues simultaneously in isolated worktrees
uv run adw_plan_build_iso.py 101 &
uv run adw_plan_build_iso.py 102 &
uv run adw_plan_build_iso.py 103 &
uv run adw_plan_build_iso.py 104 &
uv run adw_plan_build_iso.py 105 &
wait
# Each gets unique ports, isolated workspace
```

## Workflow Types

### Standard Workflows

**Purpose:** Single execution environment, sequential processing
**Use When:** Processing issues one at a time
**Workspace:** Main repository directory
**Isolation Method:** Git branches (feature branches)

**How It Works:**
```
Your Repo: /Users/you/project/
├── .git/
├── app/
└── adws/

Workflow creates branch: feat-123-a1b2c3d4-add-feature
All work happens in main repo on this branch
```

**Available Workflows:**

```bash
# Individual Phases
adw_plan.py              # Planning phase
adw_build.py             # Implementation phase
adw_test.py              # Testing phase
adw_review.py            # Review phase
adw_document.py          # Documentation phase
adw_patch.py             # Quick patch workflow

# Orchestrators
adw_plan_build.py                    # Plan → Build
adw_plan_build_test.py               # Plan → Build → Test
adw_plan_build_review.py             # Plan → Build → Review
adw_plan_build_test_review.py        # Plan → Build → Test → Review
adw_plan_build_document.py           # Plan → Build → Document
adw_sdlc.py                          # Plan → Build → Test → Review → Document
```

### ISO Workflows (Isolated Execution)

**Purpose:** Parallel execution in isolated git worktrees
**Use When:** Processing multiple issues simultaneously (15x throughput)
**Workspace:** Dedicated git worktree per ADW ID
**Isolation Method:** Git worktrees (separate working directories)
**Ports:** Dynamically allocated (9100-9114 backend, 9200-9214 frontend)

**How It Works:**
```
Main Repo: /Users/you/project/
├── .git/                           # Shared git database
├── app/
└── adws/

Worktree 1: /Users/you/project/.worktrees/a1b2c3d4/
├── .git                            # Linked to main .git
├── .ports.env                      # BACKEND_PORT=9101, FRONTEND_PORT=9201
├── app/                            # Isolated copy
└── adws/                           # Isolated copy
    └── Running on branch: feat-123-a1b2c3d4-add-feature

Worktree 2: /Users/you/project/.worktrees/e5f6g7h8/
├── .git                            # Linked to main .git
├── .ports.env                      # BACKEND_PORT=9102, FRONTEND_PORT=9202
├── app/                            # Isolated copy (different issue)
└── adws/                           # Isolated copy
    └── Running on branch: bug-456-e5f6g7h8-fix-login

Both worktrees share the same .git database but have:
- Separate working directories (no file conflicts)
- Separate branches (no git conflicts)
- Separate ports (no server conflicts)
- Can run dev servers simultaneously
```

**Git Worktree vs Branch:**

| Aspect | Standard (Branch) | ISO (Worktree) |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Working Directory | Single (main repo) | Multiple (one per worktree) |
| Branch Switching | `git checkout` changes files | No switching, each worktree on different branch |
| Parallel Work | ❌ Must finish before next | ✅ Multiple workflows simultaneously |
| File Conflicts | ⚠️ Possible when switching | ✅ Impossible (separate directories) |
| Dev Servers | ⚠️ Only one at a time | ✅ Multiple with unique ports |
| Performance | Sequential (1x) | Parallel (up to 15x) |
| Cleanup | `git branch -d` | `git worktree remove` |

**Key Differences from Standard:**
- ✅ Creates isolated git worktree (separate working directory)
- ✅ Allocates unique ports (no conflicts, multiple dev servers)
- ✅ Writes `.ports.env` for app configuration
- ✅ Enables true parallel execution (15 workflows simultaneously)
- ✅ Zero interference between workflows (separate filesystems)
- ✅ Each worktree can run tests independently
- ✅ Changes committed to different branches from isolated locations

**Available ISO Workflows (14 total):**

```bash
# Individual Phases
adw_plan_iso.py          # Planning phase (isolated)
adw_build_iso.py         # Implementation phase (isolated)
adw_test_iso.py          # Testing phase (isolated)
adw_review_iso.py        # Review phase (isolated)
adw_document_iso.py      # Documentation phase (isolated)
adw_patch_iso.py         # Quick patch workflow (isolated)

# Orchestrators
adw_plan_build_iso.py                # Plan → Build (isolated)
adw_plan_build_test_iso.py           # Plan → Build → Test (isolated)
adw_plan_build_review_iso.py         # Plan → Build → Review (isolated)
adw_plan_build_test_review_iso.py    # Plan → Build → Test → Review (isolated)
adw_plan_build_document_iso.py       # Plan → Build → Document (isolated)
adw_sdlc_iso.py                      # Full SDLC (isolated)
adw_sdlc_zte_iso.py                  # Full SDLC with Zero Touch Execution
adw_ship_iso.py                      # Build → Test → Deploy (isolated)
```

### ZTE Workflows (Zero Touch Execution)

**Purpose:** Fully autonomous operation with self-healing
**Use When:** Production automation, continuous deployment
**Workspace:** ISO worktree (always isolated)
**Autonomy Level:** Level 5 - Full autonomous operation

**What Makes ZTE Different:**

| Feature | Standard/ISO | ZTE (Zero Touch Execution) |
|---------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Error Handling | Manual intervention needed | ✅ Self-healing, auto-retry |
| Test Failures | Requires manual fix | ✅ Automatic resolution (up to 5 attempts) |
| Deployment | Manual approval | ✅ Auto-deploy when tests pass |
| Monitoring | Manual status checks | ✅ Continuous self-monitoring |
| Recovery | Manual rollback | ✅ Automatic rollback on failure |
| Human Involvement | Required for decisions | ✅ Fully autonomous (zero touch) |

**ZTE Capabilities:**

1. **Self-Healing**
   - Automatically detects and fixes test failures
   - Retries failed operations with different strategies
   - Learns from previous failures

2. **Auto-Deployment**
   - Deploys to staging when tests pass
   - Runs smoke tests in staging
   - Auto-promotes to production if stable

3. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Tracks workflow health in real-time
   - Reports metrics to KPI dashboard
   - Alerts on anomalies

4. **Automatic Rollback**
   - Detects production failures
   - Automatically reverts to last stable version
   - Creates incident report

**Available ZTE Workflows:**

```bash
adw_sdlc_zte_iso.py      # Full SDLC with Zero Touch Execution
                         # Autonomous: Plan → Build → Test → Review →
                         # Document → Deploy → Monitor
```

**Example ZTE Workflow:**
```bash
# Start autonomous processing
uv run adws/adw_sdlc_zte_iso.py 123

# What happens automatically (no human intervention):
# 1. Creates isolated worktree
# 2. Plans implementation
# 3. Implements solution
# 4. Runs tests (auto-fixes failures up to 5 attempts)
# 5. Reviews implementation
# 6. Generates documentation
# 7. Deploys to staging
# 8. Runs smoke tests
# 9. Promotes to production (if tests pass)
# 10. Monitors for 24 hours
# 11. Auto-rollback if issues detected
# 12. Updates KPI dashboard
# 13. Cleans up worktree

# Result: Fully autonomous software delivery
```

### Workflow Selection Matrix

| Scenario | Recommended Workflow | Why |
|----------|---------------------|-----|
| Single issue, quick fix | `adw_plan_build.py` | Fast, no testing overhead, main repo |
| Single issue, production code | `adw_sdlc.py` | Full validation, documentation, main repo |
| Multiple issues (5-15) | `adw_sdlc_iso.py` (parallel) | 15x throughput via worktrees |
| Hot fix needed | `adw_patch.py` | Skips planning, direct patch, main repo |
| Experimental feature | `adw_plan_build_test_iso.py` | Isolated worktree, won't affect main |
| Documentation update | `adw_plan_build_document.py` | Skips testing, focuses on docs |
| Code review changes | `adw_build_iso.py` | Isolated implementation only |
| Continuous delivery | `adw_sdlc_zte_iso.py` | Fully autonomous, self-healing, auto-deploy |
| Batch processing | `adw_sdlc_iso.py` (parallel) | Process multiple issues simultaneously |

## Meta-Agentic Capabilities

### 1. Worktree Isolation (Level 3)

**What It Does:**
Creates isolated git worktrees for each ADW run, enabling parallel execution without conflicts.

**Setup:**
```bash
# Install a worktree for ADW ID
/install_worktree <adw-id>

# Cleanup worktrees (removes completed/stale worktrees)
/cleanup_worktrees
```

**How It Works:**
```
Main Repo: /Users/you/project/
├── .git/
├── app/
└── adws/

Worktree 1: /Users/you/project/.worktrees/a1b2c3d4/
├── .git (linked to main)
├── .ports.env (BACKEND_PORT=9101, FRONTEND_PORT=9201)
├── app/ (isolated copy)
└── adws/ (isolated copy)

Worktree 2: /Users/you/project/.worktrees/e5f6g7h8/
├── .git (linked to main)
├── .ports.env (BACKEND_PORT=9102, FRONTEND_PORT=9202)
├── app/ (isolated copy)
└── adws/ (isolated copy)
```

**Port Allocation:**
- Backend: 9100-9114 (15 ports available)
- Frontend: 9200-9214 (15 ports available)
- Deterministic based on ADW ID hash
- No port conflicts possible

**Benefits:**
- Run 15 workflows simultaneously
- Zero interference between workflows
- Each workflow has dedicated dev server
- Safe parallel execution

### 2. Dynamic Model Selection (Level 3)

**What It Does:**
Automatically selects the optimal AI model based on task complexity and state configuration.

**Model Sets:**

| Model Set | Primary Model | Use Case | Cost | Speed |
|-----------|--------------|----------|------|-------|
| `base` | claude-sonnet-4.5 | Default, most tasks | Lower | Faster |
| `heavy` | claude-opus-4 | Complex implementation | Higher | Slower |

**Commands with Dynamic Selection:**

```python
# Uses heavy model in heavy mode, sonnet in base mode
COMMANDS_WITH_DYNAMIC_SELECTION = [
    "/implement",           # Implementation tasks
    "/resolve_failed_test", # Test failure resolution
    "/resolve_failed_e2e_test", # E2E test failures
    "/document",           # Documentation generation
    "/chore",              # Maintenance tasks
    "/bug",                # Bug fixes
    "/feature",            # New features
    "/patch"               # Quick patches
]

# Always uses sonnet (fast, efficient)
COMMANDS_ALWAYS_SONNET = [
    "/classify_issue",     # Issue classification
    "/classify_adw",       # ADW classification
    "/review",             # Code review
    "/test",               # Test execution
    "/start",              # App startup
    "/install"             # Dependency installation
]
```

**Configuration:**

Set in state or issue body:
```json
{
  "model_set": "heavy"  // Use opus for complex tasks
}
```

Or let classifier decide automatically based on issue complexity.

**Location:** `adws/adw_modules/agent.py` - `get_model_for_slash_command()`

### 3. KPI Tracking Dashboard (Level 3)

**What It Does:**
Tracks system performance metrics and generates performance dashboards.

**Command:**
```bash
/track_agentic_kpis <state-json>
```

**Metrics Tracked:**

**Agentic KPIs (Summary):**
- Current Streak (consecutive workflows with ≤2 attempts)
- Longest Streak
- Total Plan Size (lines of planning)
- Largest Plan Size
- Total Diff Size (lines changed)
- Largest Diff Size
- Average Presence (average attempts per workflow)

**ADW KPIs (Per Workflow):**
- Date
- ADW ID
- Issue Number
- Issue Class
- Attempts (how many plan/patch iterations)
- Plan Size (lines)
- Diff Size (added/removed/files)
- Created/Updated timestamps

**Output:**
Creates/updates `app_docs/agentic_kpis.md` with formatted tables.

**Purpose:**
- Track system efficiency over time
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Measure autonomous operation success
- Build learning datasets

### 4. Meta-Command Generation (Level 4)

**What It Does:**
System generates its own new slash commands based on natural language descriptions.

**Command:**
```bash
/meta-command <command-name> "<description>"
```

**Example:**
```bash
/meta-command deploy-staging "Deploy current branch to staging environment with health checks"
```

**Output:**
- Creates `.claude/commands/deploy-staging.md`
- Follows Claude Code command conventions
- Includes proper frontmatter
- Self-documenting
- Ready to use immediately

**Capabilities:**
- Extends system without human coding
- Learns from existing command patterns
- Creates domain-specific workflows
- Self-improvement capability

**Location:** `meta-agent` in `.claude/agents/`

### 5. Health Check System (Level 3)

**What It Does:**
Validates ADW system health and identifies configuration issues.

**Command:**
```bash
/health_check
```

**Checks:**
- Environment variables (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, GITHUB_REPO_URL, etc.)
- Claude Code CLI installation
- GitHub authentication
- Python dependencies (uv)
- Core modules import successfully
- Workflow files exist and are executable
- State directory is writable
- Git configuration

**Output:**
```
ADW Health Check Results
========================

✅ Environment Variables
✅ Claude Code CLI (v1.2.3)
✅ GitHub Authentication
✅ Python Dependencies
✅ Core Modules
✅ Workflow Files (28 workflows found)
✅ State Directory
✅ Git Configuration

Status: HEALTHY
All systems operational.
```

**Use Cases:**
- Troubleshooting setup issues
- Pre-deployment validation
- Continuous monitoring
- Template health verification

### 6. In-Loop Review (Level 3)

**What It Does:**
Continuously reviews implementation during build phase, catching issues early.

**Command:**
```bash
/in_loop_review <state-json>
```

**How It Works:**
1. Monitors implementation progress
2. Reviews code changes incrementally
3. Identifies issues before testing phase
4. Suggests improvements in real-time
5. Reduces test-fix cycles

**Benefits:**
- Earlier issue detection
- Faster overall workflow
- Better code quality
- Reduced rework

## State Management

### State Lifecycle

```
1. Workflow Start
   ↓
   ADW ID generated (e.g., a1b2c3d4)
   ↓
2. State Initialization
   ↓
   Create agents/a1b2c3d4/adw_state.json
   ↓
3. Phase Execution
   ↓
   Each phase reads/updates state
   ↓
4. State Persistence
   ↓
   Written after each phase
   ↓
5. Workflow Completion
   ↓
   Final state saved for history
```

### State File Structure

**Location:** `agents/{adw_id}/adw_state.json`

**Complete Schema:**

```json
{
  "adw_id": "a1b2c3d4",
  "issue_number": "123",
  "branch_name": "feat-123-a1b2c3d4-add-user-auth",
  "plan_file": "agents/a1b2c3d4/a1b2c3d4_plan_spec.md",
  "issue_class": "/feature",
  "worktree_path": "/path/to/.worktrees/a1b2c3d4",
  "backend_port": 9101,
  "frontend_port": 9201,
  "model_set": "base",
  "all_adws": ["a1b2c3d4", "e5f6g7h8"]
}
```

### State Operations

**Create State:**
```python
from adw_modules.state import ADWState

state = ADWState("a1b2c3d4")
state.update(
    issue_number="123",

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Required:**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export GITHUB_REPO_URL="https://github.com/owner/repo"
```

**Optional:**
```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_PATH="claude"              # Default: "claude"
export CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR="true"  # Maintain working directory
export GITHUB_PAT="ghp_..."                   # Only if not using 'gh auth'

```

### Model Configuration

**Edit:** `adws/adw_modules/agent.py`

**Model Selection Map:**
```python
SLASH_COMMAND_MODEL_MAP = {
    "/implement": {"base": "sonnet", "heavy": "opus"},
    "/bug": {"base": "sonnet", "heavy": "opus"},
    "/feature": {"base": "sonnet", "heavy": "opus"},
    "/patch": {"base": "sonnet", "heavy": "opus"},
    "/document": {"base": "sonnet", "heavy": "opus"},
    "/resolve_failed_test": {"base": "sonnet", "heavy": "opus"},
    "/resolve_failed_e2e_test": {"base": "sonnet", "heavy": "opus"},
    "/chore": {"base": "sonnet", "heavy": "opus"},

    # Always use sonnet (fast, efficient)
    "/classify_issue": {"base": "sonnet", "heavy": "sonnet"},
    "/classify_adw": {"base": "sonnet", "heavy": "sonnet"},
    "/review": {"base": "sonnet", "heavy": "sonnet"},
    "/test": {"base": "sonnet", "heavy": "sonnet"},
}
```

**Model Names:**
- `"sonnet"` → `claude-sonnet-4.5-20250929`
- `"opus"` → `claude-opus-4-20250514`

### Webhook Configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Health Check First

```bash
/health_check
```

This validates:
- Environment variables
- Claude Code installation
- GitHub authentication
- Dependencies
- Workflow files
- System configuration

### Common Issues

#### "Claude Code CLI is not installed"
```bash
# Check installation
which claude

# Install from https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code
```

#### "Missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
```bash
# Set API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Verify
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

#### "GitHub authentication failed"
```bash
# Authenticate with GitHub CLI
gh auth login

# Verify
gh auth status
```

#### "Module not found" errors
```bash
# Install with uv
cd adws
uv sync --all-extras

# Verify
uv run python -c "from adw_modules import state; print('OK')"
```

#### "Port already in use" (ISO workflows)
```bash
# Check allocated ports
cat .worktrees/*/ports.env

# Kill process on port
lsof -ti:9101 | xargs kill -9

# Or cleanup worktrees
/cleanup_worktrees
```

#### "Worktree creation failed"
```bash
# Check git worktree list
git worktree list

# Remove stale worktrees
git worktree prune

# Manual cleanup
rm -rf .worktrees/<adw-id>
git worktree remove .worktrees/<adw-id>
```

#### "Agent execution timeout"
```bash
# Check logs
cat agents/<adw-id>/*/raw_output.jsonl | tail -1 | jq .

# Common causes:
# - Model overload (switch to sonnet)
# - Network issues (check connection)
# - Complex task (use heavy model set)
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable verbose logging
export ADW_DEBUG=true

# Run workflow
uv run adws/adw_plan_build.py 123

# Check execution logs
cat agents/<adw-id>/*/execution.log
```

### Workflow Output Structure

Each workflow creates diagnostic outputs:

```
agents/<adw-id>/
├── adw_state.json              # State file
├── <adw-id>_plan_spec.md       # Implementation plan
├── planner/
│   ├── execution.log           # Planning logs
│   └── raw_output.jsonl        # Claude Code session
├── implementor/
│   ├── execution.log
│   └── raw_output.jsonl
├── tester/
│   ├── execution.log
│   └── raw_output.jsonl
├── reviewer/
│   ├── execution.log
│   ├── raw_output.jsonl
│   └── review_img/             # Screenshots
└── documenter/
    ├── execution.log
    └── raw_output.jsonl
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check Logs:** `agents/<adw-id>/*/execution.log`
2. **Run Health Check:** `/health_check`
3. **View Raw Output:** `cat agents/<adw-id>/*/raw_output.jsonl | jq .`
4. **Check State:** `cat agents/<adw-id>/adw_state.json | jq .`
5. **Test Integration:** `uv run adws/adw_tests/test_integration.py`

## Advanced Usage

### Parallel Execution Example

**Process 10 issues simultaneously:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# process_batch.sh

issues=(101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110)

for issue in "${issues[@]}"; do
    uv run adws/adw_sdlc_iso.py "$issue" &
done

wait

echo "All issues processed!"
/track_agentic_kpis
```

**Result:**
- 10 isolated worktrees created
- Unique ports allocated to each
- Parallel execution (10x faster than sequential)
- Zero interference
- KPI dashboard updated with metrics

### Custom Workflow Creation

**Generate new workflow via meta-command:**

```bash
/meta-command deploy-production "Build, test, and deploy to production with rollback capability"
```

**Result:**
- Creates `.claude/commands/deploy-production.md`
- Includes all deployment steps
- Ready to use immediately
- Self-documenting

### KPI Dashboard Automation

**Auto-update KPI dashboard after each workflow:**

```bash
# Add to workflow completion
uv run adws/adw_sdlc.py 123
/track_agentic_kpis "$(cat agents/<adw-id>/adw_state.json)"
```

**View dashboard:**
```bash
cat app_docs/agentic_kpis.md
```

### Continuous Monitoring Setup

**Option 1: Cron-based (polling every 20s)**
```bash
# Start monitor
nohup uv run adws/adw_triggers/trigger_cron.py > /tmp/adw_cron.log 2>&1 &
```

**Option 2: Webhook (instant processing)**
```bash
# Start webhook server
export GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET="your-secret"
nohup uv run adws/adw_triggers/trigger_webhook.py > /tmp/adw_webhook.log 2>&1 &
```

## Performance Metrics

### Throughput Comparison

| Execution Mode | Issues/Hour | Workflows/Hour | Speedup |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| Sequential (standard) | 1-2 | 1-2 | 1x (baseline) |
| Parallel (ISO, 5 workers) | 5-10 | 5-10 | 5x |
| Parallel (ISO, 10 workers) | 10-20 | 10-20 | 10x |
| Parallel (ISO, 15 workers) | 15-30 | 15-30 | 15x (max) |

### Cost Optimization

**Model Selection Impact:**

| Model Set | Model | Cost per 1M tokens | Avg Task Cost | Use Case |
|-----------|-------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| base | sonnet-4.5 | $3 input / $15 output | $0.50-2.00 | Most workflows |
| heavy | opus-4 | $15 input / $75 output | $5.00-15.00 | Complex tasks only |

**Recommendation:**
- Use `base` (sonnet) for 90% of workflows
- Reserve `heavy` (opus) for:
  - Complex refactorings
  - Architecture changes
  - Critical bug fixes
  - Large feature implementations

---

## Security Best Practices

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Store all secrets in environment, never in code
   - Use `.env` files (never commit)
   - Rotate API keys regularly

2. **GitHub Tokens**
   - Use fine-grained tokens with minimal permissions
   - Required: `issues:write`, `pull_requests:write`, `contents:write`
   - Set expiration dates

3. **Branch Protection**
   - Require PR reviews for main branch
   - Enable status checks
   - Require signed commits (optional)

4. **Webhook Security**
   - Always use webhook secrets
   - Validate signatures on every request
   - Use HTTPS only
   - Rate limit webhook endpoint

5. **API Monitoring**
   - Set billing alerts in Anthropic dashboard
   - Monitor API usage via `/track_agentic_kpis`
   - Review costs regularly

6. **Access Control**
   - Limit who can trigger workflows
   - Use GitHub Teams for permissions
   - Audit workflow executions
