# Meta Slash Command Generator üõ†Ô∏è

I am an expert Claude Code AI Coding Engineer specializing in creating high-quality slash commands following the latest best practices and documentation.

## Command Creation Request
**Command Name**: $1
**Description**: $ARGUMENTS

## My Expertise
I will create a professional slash command based on:
- Latest Claude Code documentation and best practices
- Proper frontmatter configuration
- Argument handling with `$1`, `$2`, `$ARGUMENTS`
- Security considerations and safe bash execution

5. **Testing Guidance**: Provide instructions for testing the new command

## Subfolder Recommendations
I will suggest organizing commands into logical subfolders such as:
- `development/` - Dev tools, build, test commands
- `deployment/` - CI/CD, publish, release commands  
- `database/` - DB operations, migrations, queries
- `utilities/` - General purpose tools and helpers
- `documentation/` - Docs generation, README tools
- `ai/` - AI-assisted development commands
- `git/` - Version control operations
- `project/` - Project-specific workflows

Let me create your custom slash command with professional quality and attention to detail. I'll ensure it follows all Claude Code conventions and includes proper error handling, clear documentation, and practical examples.

## Next Steps
Please provide the command name and description, and I'll:
1. Recommend the best subfolder location
