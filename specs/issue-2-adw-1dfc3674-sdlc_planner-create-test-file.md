# Chore: Create test.txt file with "hi" content

## Metadata
issue_number: `2`
adw_id: `1dfc3674`
issue_json: `{"number":2,"title":"test","body":"adw_plan\n\nMake a test.txt fiels iwth \"hi\" in in my root project directory"}`

## Chore Description
Create a simple test.txt file in the root project directory containing the text "hi". This is a basic file creation task to validate the ADW workflow system.

## Relevant Files
No existing files are relevant to this chore as it involves creating a new file.

### New Files
- `test.txt` - A new text file to be created in the root project directory (`/Users/crossgenai/Projects/ai-in-4/`) containing the string "hi"

## Step by Step Tasks
IMPORTANT: Execute every step in order, top to bottom.

### 1. Create test.txt file in root directory
- Create a new file named `test.txt` in the root project directory `/Users/crossgenai/Projects/ai-in-4/`
- Add the content "hi" to the file

### 2. Validate file creation
- Verify the file exists at the correct location
- Confirm the file contains the expected content "hi"
- Run the `Validation Commands` to validate the chore is complete with zero regressions

## Validation Commands
Execute every command to validate the chore is complete with zero regressions.

- `ls -la test.txt` - Verify the file exists in the root directory
- `cat test.txt` - Verify the file contains "hi"
- `cd app/server && uv run pytest` - Run server tests to validate the chore is complete with zero regressions

## Notes
- This is a simple file creation task that serves as a test of the ADW planning and execution workflow
- No dependencies on existing code or configuration
- The file should be created at the root level of the project, not in any subdirectory
